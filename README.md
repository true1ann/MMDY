# `mmdy` - Mini Material Design You ("MiniMDY", "MMDY", "MM3")

> [!Important]
> `mmdy` is NOT something Google has control over, I, @true1ann just dont exactly like how Google disrespects Web, by not releasing even basic components like a Card for the Web.
> `mmdy` tries to close the gaps, by fully rewriting it, making it easy, and JS-less (< perfect for static websites).
> On the other hand, I WILL NOT provide support for the Backend Extensions (more on them later, later referenced as 'BE'), make an issue if you are SURE the issue is not caused by a BE.

> [!Important]
> `mmdy` DOES NOT come with any JS, or TS for making websites. The Web version of `mmdy`'s documentation uses raw `mmdy`, without any BEs. You either use Raw `mmdy` ('Barebones' package) OR use a BE

## What are Backend Extensions?

Backend Extensions (later referenced as 'BE') use `mmdy` AND your Backend Service (i.e. React, Vue, Sintasq, etc) to display webpages with the `mmdy` styling, a BE should

  1. Register `mmdy` components into an Backend Service
  2. Provide APIs for changing sizings, colors, etc of a component

## License

[MIT](LICENSE) (TL;DR: you can do anything with this)
**BEs are not tied to the same license as `mmdy`.**

## How to begin using `mmdy`?

You can use our [Web documentation](https://ann.is-a.dev/MMDY) to learn about available and trusted BEs, and about M3 as a whole. (its not there, yet.)

## Again, `mmdy` IS NOT SOMETHING GOOGLE MADE

PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF GOD, IF YOU WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING ELSE THAN WEBPAGES WITH MMDY: YOU FUCKING CANNOT, USE [OFFICIAL M3 **BY GOOGLE**](https://m3.material.io). THIS IS RAW CSS GOD FUCKING DANG IT

## Also another funny detail

There is MANY stolen code, biggest sources is M3 specs (no shit), Bootstrap and MMDY.scss (previous MMDY version)
